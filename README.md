Enter your question or situation: what will my dreams be like tonight?
Card Draw:
Card 1: Judgement
Card 2: The Hanged Man
Card 3: The Tower

Interpretation:
This combination of cards suggests that your dreams tonight may be intense and transformative. The Judgement card indicates that your subconscious may be processing past experiences and making judgments about your life. The Hanged Man suggests that you may feel suspended or stuck in your dreams, as if you are being forced to see things from a different perspective. The Tower card indicates unexpected change or upheaval, which may manifest in your dreams as chaos or destruction. Overall, these cards suggest that your dreams tonight may be unsettling, but also offer the opportunity for growth and self-reflection. Pay attention to any insights or revelations that come up in your dreams, as they may hold valuable lessons for you
